- Your wins and failed attempts are recorded

## Requirements
1. Create a hangman game that inputs key presses from the user
2. Track guesses and number of wins
3. Win result in an increase in the win count and both wins and losses result in the loading of a new word

## Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- Web Fonts (from Google Fonts)
- TypeIt for visual effect
- jQuery for visual effect and TypeIt requires it

## Code Explaination
- Basically, the meat and potatoes of the code is in the JavaScript file (game.js), where the variables and game logic is stored
- The HTML sets up the basic elements of the game such as the title, pictures and audio, text elements indicating progress and points, etc.
- The CSS is really the visual aspect of this project, giving the colors and margins, etc. Flexbox was of enormous use in the project (particularly in customizing the scaling of elements)
- External web fonts, audio, and visual effects were added to spice things up
